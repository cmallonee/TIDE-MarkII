        <p class="bordered-paragraph">TIDE is an experimental, entrepreneurship-oriented course at Friends School, where high school students 
        work in self-led teams to create web pages and apps with and for local non-profit organizations. The concept of TIDE was brainstormed
        by a group of students in 2018 who, after taking two semesters of Java programming classes, felt they wanted to not only continue with 
        computer science, but also start to apply it to make a difference in the world. Most in the class are students with at least three 
        semesters of computer programming experience and some knowledge of HTML, PHP, and mySQL web databases, in addition to their 
        main talent with Java. Others in the class are web designers or social activists who also want to use their talents to make a difference. 
         All are committed to finding positive answers to the query, "How can technology help non-profits make Baltimore (and the world) a 
         better place?" </p>

                OPT: Overcoming Poverty Together is a Baltimore-based non-profit that makes micro-loans to women in Indonesia for the purpose of starting small businesses, developing independence, and promoting sustainability. <br>
        		  What we did: We took the previous OPT site which was Joomla-based, static, and difficult to edit, and converted it to HTML/PHP/mySQL and added a database feature for easy editing of the Board of Directors. <br>
